Everything in the forest has died. The trees suffer from the pollution in the air and can't survive anymore. Start putting in some hard work and they can come back!
The forest is really struggling. The pollution in the air from  the overuse of energy is too much for the environment to handle. Much more of this and it will all be gone.
The forest is getting a bit bare now. Not many trees are left as it is becoming more and more difficult for them to survive. Make sure to do your best to change this!
The forest is surviving and doing quite well. The effort you're putting in is starting to show. Keep up the changes you're making and it'll be even better!
The trees in the forest are starting to thrive now that you've committed yourself to the tasks. Trees are so important for the environment so let's keep them alive!

Everything in the forest is thriving, your sustainble ways of living have made a real difference here, and with the effort you're putting in the real world is benefitting too!
