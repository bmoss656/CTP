The grass here is dying due to the changes in the environment, grass helps feed animals, insects and thousands of other organisms, without it they cannot survive either. Make a change now! 
Your actions are just about keeping the grassland alive but you need to be careful! The environment is connected in so many ways, grass areas dying due to climate change affects so many other things.
Your changes and work towards helping the environment are starting to have a good impact. However, it is important not to get complacent at this point and stop doing your tasks, change comes from continued behaviour!
